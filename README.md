# Autoencoders
This repository contains Python codes for standard autoencoders developed on the MNSIT fashion dataset and variational autoencoders on human faces(CelebA dataset)

## Autoencoders:
Written a code and trained the model for autoencoder on the MNSIT fashion dataset, which consists of two parts: encoder and decoder. Encoder converts the picture to latent space, while the decoder uses latent space values to recreate images.

## Variational Autoencoders
Using variational autoencoder architecture, we created a face-creation model using the CelebA dataset.
